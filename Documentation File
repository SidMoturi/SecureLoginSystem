Documentation Person 1: 
Users create an account by providing a username and password. The code in the java file is where the user registration flow runs where the 
system checks that the username is unique and the password meets complexity requirements. Hashing, a specific SHA-256 secure algorithm is written in java in which 
passwords are transformed into fixed-length strings using a one-way function (SHA-256). This means the original password cannot be recovered from the hash. Additionally, I created a random salt, 
which is added to each password before hashing. This prevents attackers from using precomputed tables (rainbow tables) to crack passwords and makes sure identical passwords have different hashes.
These components work together to make passwords more secure and difficult on attackers end to hack through even in the case data is leaked.
